Thanks for considering contributing to SLikeNet™.

In case you intend to contribute changes/code which should be incorporated in SLikeNet, we kindly ask you to sign the following CLA.
Please note that signing this CLA is obviously not required, if you simply add a bugrport, provide feedback, or want to ask a question.

CLA
===

In short
--------

- By signing this agreement, you grant SLikeSoft™ UG (haftungsbeschänkt) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to use your contribution to be incorporated in our product(s).
- You declare that you are legally entitled to grant us such license.
- This agreement is valid until revoked for this and all following contributions.
- Revoking the agreement for previous contributions is possible in certain cases (please see details below).
- Send a mail to info@slikesoft.com, if we'd add you to the acknowledgement section.


Signing the agreement
---------------------

State so in a comment in your first pull request/issue report (no need to make the statement again in following contributions, since we'll have your agreement on our record).
For instance you can use the following statement for your comment:
"I hereby declare I've read and agree to the current CLA as provided under https://github.com/SLikeSoft/SLikeNet/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"

Alternatively send a mail to info@slikesoft.com and state that you agree to this CLA. In this case, make sure that we can identify you as the holder of the account who made the contribution in GitHub (f.e. ensure that your email address you send the mail from is shown on your GitHub user profile (or a linked personal page on that profile) or simply post in a comment of your contribution that you contacted us).


In detail
---------

If you don't know what a CLA is, here's a nice explaination of what this is and why it's required and/or good to have one: https://www.clahub.com/pages/why_cla

First of all we want to thank you for considering a direct contribution to the product in order to help us make it even better.
Being a company which focuses on individual privacy and personal rights, we want to make sure that you are making a deliberate decision about what it means when you contribute to the project (f.e. by adding a pull request, contributing bugfixes/patches/bugreports via GitHub issues, sending us such patches by mail, etc.). Therefore, we require all contributors to sign this CLA before we will use their contribution.

The advantage for you as the contributor is that you understand how we will use your contribution and what will happen with it.
For us this ensures us that you really meant your contribution being used by us (rather than having a different intend like only demonstrating a possible solution to a problem) and that you clarified with your contribution that we are also legally allowed to use it directly in our products.

As a German company we fall under the German copyright law which is in certain parts quite different from copyright laws in most English speaking countries (like the US). Most importantly by German law you as the contributor cannot give away the copyright of your contribution to us - you are and always will be the copyright holder of your contribution.

Hence, instead of passing on your copyright to us, we ask you to grant SLikeSoft UG (haftungsbeschränkt) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to use your contribution to incorporate it into our product(s). In non-legal language this means that you allow us to use your contribution:
- now or in the future without any deadline (i.e. perpetual)
- but are still allowed to pass along your contribution to others and also grant them a non-exclusive license of the same work as well (i.e. non-exclusive)
- worldwide and not restricted to a specific area/country (i.e. worldwide)
- without asking for monetary compensation (i.e. no-charge)
- without requiring any royalty from us or users of our product (i.e. royalty-free)

Furthermore, you ensure us by agreeing to this CLA that you are the copyright holder of the contribution (or are legally entitled to provide the necessary grants) and that it does not violate any 3rd-party claims (f.e. you wrote the code yourself and didn't copy it from some other source which did not grant you the right to actually grant us the license to use it).

This revokable agreement is valid for any contribution you do after agreeing to this CLA. You can revoke the agreement at any time for future contributions. To revoke the agreement, simply send an e-mail to info@slikesoft.com. In case you didn't mean to contribute something under the specified terms, please let us know (by e-mail to info@slikesoft.com) so we can try to work out the details. We'll try our best to also handle such revokations for already made contributions, but might not be able to do so, especially in cases where your contribution got already incorporated in an already released version/product.

In return we offer you to be recognized as a contributor to the product in the accompanying documentation. Since we hold everybody's privacy up the most, we will only add your personal details, if you decide you want that. By default such an entry will look like the following one in the acknowledgement section of the accompanying readme.txt file (please understand that in the future and/or for other products it might be displayed elsewhere/by other means too):
- [Full Name]: [personal GitHub URL] (pull request: xx)
If you'd prefer a different format (f.e. your email address being added or your pull requests not being listed), please let us know.

If you want to be added to the acknowledgement section, please send a short mail to info@slikesoft.com with some proof that you are the holder of the contributing GitHub account (f.e. ensure that your email address you send the mail from is shown on your GitHub user profile (or a linked personal page on that profile) or simply post in a comment of your contribution that you contacted us.

Note that once we get such a mail, we'll add your entry in the earliest possible next release (f.e. if the next release is already in the release pipeline, this might be the next next release) and list all your previous pull requests by default. If you'd rather want only the current and future pull requests being listed with your name but not previous ones, please state so explicitly in your mail.

A final word on this license: Please understand that we are no legal experts. If you spot an issue with this agreement, if you think something is unclear, or if we are in violation of something, we'd appreciate if you contact us by mail to correct the mishap (datenschutz@slikesoft.com).
